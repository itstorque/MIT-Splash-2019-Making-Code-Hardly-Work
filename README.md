## YEETIFY

Yeetify is a python program that converts elegant C code into different variations of the word "yeet". Executing the script is very easy, all you have to run is:

```bash
python3 yeetify.py [file.c]
```

This creates a C program that looks like

```C
yeett YEET Yeeet
   yeet Yeeeet yeetyeet yeeeeT yoted
   Yeet yeeten yoted
yeeeT
```
